# VSCode C++ Starting Template

## Introduction

Setting up C++ in Visual Studio Code (VSCode) can be challenging, especially for those new to C++ or VSCode. Coming from higher-level languages like C# with IDEs such as JetBrains Rider, where tasks like linking and debugging are seamlessly handled, the experience in VSCode can feel less intuitive.

After spending time figuring out the setup process, I created this template to save you the hassle. While it's not groundbreaking, this template is designed to help you quickly set up your environment and start coding without unnecessary delays.

## Features

- Pre-configured `tasks.json` and `launch.json` for multi-file C++ projects.
- Pre-configured `CMakeLists.txt` file
- Automatic linking of all `.cpp` files in the `src` folderâ€”no need to manually list them.

## Warnings

- This template is prepared for a Linux environment
